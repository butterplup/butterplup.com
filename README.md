# butterplup.com
A basic website for me to learn basic HTML/CSS/JS, act as a portfolio, and have some poems.
Hosted using Firebase with a current URL of "butterplup.web.app".

## Content

Other than the landing page, this website has three main areas. They are as follows: 
- about me
- poetry
- projects

The about me section contains information about me (obviously) possibly to act like a cover letter. The poetry section includes a collection of poems. The projects section is intended to include either descriptions of software related things I'm doing, or interactive apps. 

## Design

As an introduction to web development, this website is made solely using plain ol' HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Currently it is only designed to be used on larger screens such as laptops and desktop computers (as a rule of thumb the very minimum resolution should be around 1080x800) and looks quite odd on smaller screens.
